# Draft - In Progress

# Kevin Cookie Company Consulting Project
Analyzing e-commerce performance from the Kevin Cookie Company, leveraging Python & Tableau. 

## Background & Overview
As a quick analysis, the 18-month product details were shared with me as a data analyst to provide recommendations for improvement for the company. Based on the features provided, my goal is to analyze opportunities to improve product mix (based on sales by product type), analyze seasonality within the data (overall performance trends) and to determine overall trends in profitability / pricing that would be relevant to highlight in conversations with the founder. 

In initial brainstorming, I seek to define the following key metrics in my initial EDA: 

+Total Sales by Product Type
+Total Sales by Month / Year
+Total Profitability by Month / Year
+Total Cost by Month / Year
+ Trend data by Country

## Data Structure Overview
The data set contains an Excel file of 701 records with 12 features, consisting of product sales (including pricing - profit, margin, cost, date, and country as well as product type) within an 18 month timeframe for the company. 

A full overview of the initial data structure analysis performed in Python can be seen in Section 1 here: *create link in future*
